# jzGFF3autoParser
Tool for automated conversion of Maker GFF3 files into submitable EMBL or GenBank formated files.

This is a JAVA command line tool using ZooDB library (https://github.com/tzaeschke/zoodb) for object persistence. Resulting files are built from the neutrally parsed feature entities. A system of flags controls the verbosity of the content in output files.
